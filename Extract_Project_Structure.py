    """
    Generate a text file listing all files and directories in a specified path.

    Logic:
    - If include lists are specified, only those items are initially included
    - Then exclude lists are applied to filter out from the included items
    - If no include lists are specified, all items are included by default, then exclusions are applied

    Parameters:
    -----------
    path : str, optional
        The root directory to analyze. If None, uses current working directory.
    output_file : str
        The name of the output file (default: "Project-File-Structure.txt")
    exclude_folder_list : list
        List of folder paths to exclude
    exclude_filetype_list : list
        List of file extensions to exclude (without dots, e.g. ["py", "ipynb"])
    include_folder_list : list
        List of folder paths to specifically include
    include_filetype_list : list
        List of file extensions to specifically include (without dots)
